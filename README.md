# JetProcessing

JetProcessing is a tool designed to process spectral interferometry images as they are being recorded in real time. It is developed in C++ using Qt5, and it implements several CUDA kernels to optionally increase the processing capabilities.

The main application is to observe density distributions of transparent gas flows, such as supersonic gas jets, in real time.
